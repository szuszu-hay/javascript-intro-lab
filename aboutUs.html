                Sheffield's impressive multi award-winning Winter Garden is one
                of the largest temperate glasshouses to be built in the UK
                during the last hundred years and is the largest urban
                glasshouse anywhere in Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                The building itself is 70 metres long and 22 metres high (large
                enough to house 5000 domestic greenhouses) and home to more than
                2500 plants from all around the world.
